# HTML & CSS Projects

This repository contains larger and more structured HTML and CSS projects created as part of my web development learning path.

## Purpose
These projects were built to practice:
- Page layout and structure
- Responsive design concepts
- Flexbox and basic Bootstrap usage
- Building complete static pages (e.g. landing pages)

## Projects Included
- Bootstrap-based layouts
- Flexbox practice projects
- Full landing page examples
- Early template experiments

## Status
This repository is **not actively maintained**.
It remains as a record of my foundational web development experience.

## Relevance
Understanding how web pages are structured and styled is essential for analyzing client-side behavior and vulnerabilities in web security.
